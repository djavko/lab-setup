# lab-setup
Things to get the KU lab off the ground.
Starting date at the Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, is July 29th, 2018. 
The lab will be located in the Integrated Sciences Building in room 2199, and adjoining offices for the researchers. My office is #2191.

Need to hire a postdoc almost immediately and a graduate student in the fall.
